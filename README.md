# memory_game
I am trying to made a game by using JQuery Html and CSS.   the concept of these project it's about "memory game".  when you press start one color It will show up in one square after 5 sec it will Disappears and then user should fill the empty squares then press 'done' to go to the next level  before the time is up!
